# Blender SysDolphin Addon
A Blender addon for importing gamecube .dat models into Blender. This addon is currently developed predominantly for `Pokemon Colosseum` and `Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness` but may have some compatibility with other games that use the format (based on the sysdolphin library) such as `Super Smash Bros. Melee`, `Kirby Air ride`, `Chibi-Robo! Plug Into Adventure!` and `Killer7`.
Original implementation provided by Made. 

# How to use

This addon is targeted at Blender versions 3.1 and above, older versions may not work as intended. When the addon is enabled, navigate to File > Import > Gamecube model (.dat) and select your .dat model.
